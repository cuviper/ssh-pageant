ssh\-pageant - authentication agent
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBssh\-pageant\fP [\fB\-c\fP | \fB\-s\fP] [\fB\-a\fP \fIsocket\fP]
[\fIcommand\fP [\fIarg ...\fP]]

\fBssh\-pageant\fP [\fB\-c\fP | \fB\-s\fP] \fB\-k\fP 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBssh\-pageant\fP is an SSH authentication agent for Cygwin that links OpenSSH
to PuTTY's Pageant.  It acts very much like ssh\-agent, except it leaves the key
storage to a separately-invoked Pageant instance.
.SH INVOCATION
A UNIX-domain socket is first created which proxies authentication requests to
Pageant.  If a \fIcommand\fP is supplied, this is executed with any additional
arguments given and with environment variables set to use the new socket.
Otherwise, ssh\-pageant runs in the background and prints shell commands
intended to set the same environment variables for the calling shell.
.PP
If invoked with \fB\-k\fP, ssh\-pageant will instead kill its previous instance
and print shell commands to unset the environment variables.
.SH OPTIONS
The standard GNU option formats are accepted, with single dashes introducing
short options and double dashes introducing long options, e.g.
\fB\-o\fP\ \fIarg\fP, \fB\-\-option\fP\ \fIarg\fP, and
\fB\-\-option=\fP\fIarg\fP.  Options marked with \fB(*)\fP are meant to be
equivalent to the same option in ssh\-agent.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Display a summary of options and exit.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
Display version and copyright information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP
Use C-style shell commands. \fB(*)\fP
.TP
\fB\-s\fP
Use Bourne-style shell commands. \fB(*)\fP
.TP
\fB\-k\fP
Kill the current ssh-pageant process. \fB(*)\fP
.TP
\fB\-d\fP
Enable debug mode. \fB(*)\fP
.TP
\fB\-q\fP
Enable quiet mode.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP \fIsocket\fP
Bind to a specific \fIsocket\fP address. \fB(*)\fP
.TP
\fB\-r\fP, \fB\-\-reuse\fP
Allow reusing an existing \fB\-a\fP \fIsocket\fP
.TP
\fB\-t\fP \fItime\fP
Limit key lifetime (not supported by Pageant). \fB(*)\fP
.SH USAGE
The commands that ssh\-pageant outputs are best used with the shell's "eval"
command.  For example, this configuration will automatically configure the
agent for each bash session:
.TP
\fB~/.bash_profile\fP:
.nf
if [ -z "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" -a -x /usr/bin/ssh-pageant ]; then
  eval $(/usr/bin/ssh-pageant -q)
fi
trap logout HUP
.fi
.TP
\fB~/.bash_logout\fP:
.nf
if [ -x /usr/bin/ssh-pageant -a ! -z "$SSH_PAGEANT_PID" ]; then
  eval $(/usr/bin/ssh-pageant -qk 2>/dev/null)
fi
.fi
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
\fBSHELL\fP
Determines the default style of shell commands.  If it contains "csh", then
\fB\-c\fP will be used, otherwise \fB\-s\fP is assumed.
.TP
\fBSSH_AUTH_SOCK\fP
Holds the path to the agent's UNIX-domain socket.
.TP
\fBSSH_PAGEANT_PID\fP
Holds the agent's process ID, used by \fB\-k\fP to kill it.
.SH ISSUES
Please report bugs or suggest enhancements via the issue tracker at
<\fIhttp://github.com/cuviper/ssh-pageant/issues\fP>.
.SH CAVEAT
Since pageant doesn't support time limits, invoking ssh-add with the -t option will result in a response of SSH_AGENT_FAILURE.
